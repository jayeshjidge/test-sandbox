# ðŸŽ¨ Quick Customization Guide

## ðŸš€ Before You Deploy - Essential Changes

### 1. **Replace Personal Information**

#### In `index.html`, find and replace:
- `[Your Anniversary Date]` â†’ Your actual anniversary date (e.g., "February 14, 2021")
- `[Her Name]` â†’ Your girlfriend's name
- `[Your Name]` â†’ Your name

### 2. **Update Quiz Questions & Answers**

#### Quiz Questions (in `index.html`):
Current questions are generic. Make them specific to your relationship:

**Question 1**: "Where did we have our first date?"
- Update options A, B, C, D with real places

**Question 2**: "What's my favorite thing about you?"
- Personalize the options

**Question 3**: "What's our favorite song?"
- Replace with your actual favorite songs

**Question 4**: "What's our dream destination?"
- Add places you've actually talked about

**Question 5**: "What do I love most about our relationship?"
- Make it personal to your relationship

#### Quiz Answers (in `script.js`, lines 85-91):
```javascript
const correctAnswers = {
    1: 'A', // Change to the correct letter for question 1
    2: 'D', // Change to the correct letter for question 2
    3: 'D', // Change to the correct letter for question 3
    4: 'D', // Change to the correct letter for question 4
    5: 'D'  // Change to the correct letter for question 5
};
```

### 3. **Replace Photos**

#### Upload your photos and replace these URLs in `index.html`:

**Hero Photo** (line ~45):
```html
<img src="YOUR_PHOTO_URL_HERE" alt="Our beautiful memory" id="hero-photo">
```

**Timeline Photos** (lines ~70, 80, 90):
```html
<img src="YOUR_YEAR_1_PHOTO" alt="Year 1">
<img src="YOUR_YEAR_2_PHOTO" alt="Year 2">
<img src="YOUR_YEAR_3_PHOTO" alt="Year 3">
```

**Memory Gallery Photos** (lines ~105, 115, 125, 135):
```html
<img src="YOUR_MEMORY_1_PHOTO" alt="Memory 1">
<img src="YOUR_MEMORY_2_PHOTO" alt="Memory 2">
<img src="YOUR_MEMORY_3_PHOTO" alt="Memory 3">
<img src="YOUR_MEMORY_4_PHOTO" alt="Memory 4">
```

#### Also update memory descriptions in `script.js` (lines 150-175):
```javascript
const memories = {
    1: {
        title: "Our First Date",
        description: "Write your actual first date story here...",
        image: "YOUR_PHOTO_URL"
    },
    // ... update all 4 memories
};
```

### 4. **Personalize the Love Letter**

In `index.html`, find the `.letter-content` section and rewrite it with your own words. Make it specific to your relationship, mention actual memories, inside jokes, and future plans.

### 5. **Update Timeline Stories**

In the timeline section, replace the generic text with your actual relationship milestones:

**Year 1**: What happened when you first met/started dating
**Year 2**: Major milestones, trips, or growth in your relationship  
**Year 3**: Recent developments, current state of your relationship
